Llamas in Pyjamas
=================

This is the project repository for the Unit 1 final project for Thinkful's Swift course. Llamas in Pyjamas is a simple iOS game written using SpriteKit. This project is a shell application for students to practice adding code to an already-existing codebase.

## Students

Your steps to get started are simple:

1. Clone this project using either the `Clone in Desktop` button to the right, or the `HTTPS clone URL` above it, depending on if you'ure using a Github GUI client or the command line.
2. Open the project in XCode 6 - `File > Open...` then navigate to the folder containing the project. Click `Unit1.xcodeproj` and Xcode will do the rest!
3. Follow the instructions in the curriculum app to fill in the missing implementation details!
4. (optional) Play the game using the iOS simulator!

It's important to note that if you want to play this game on your phone, there's a couple of extra steps you'll have to take.
